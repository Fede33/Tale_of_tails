# Tale of tails
Tale of tails has been created for the adoption of pets such as cats, dogs, and rabbits. The website includes:
- an engaging homepage that introduces the project and features a game suggesting suitable animals for adoption through a series of questions
- an "About Us" page that presents the project's concept and introduces the authors
- the "Pets" page featuring all available animals for adoption. To open the profile of each pet users can just click on it. This profile describes breed, temporary residence, size of each animal. 

Users can sign up on the website, log in, and log out. To adopt an animal, an user needs to log in and fill out a form. Once an animal is adopted, it will no longer be available on the site. Additionally, users can add an animal for adoption by completing a form and uploading an image of the pet.
